					<p>
						Iâ€™m 18 years old and my blood is half filled with moroccan tea. Iâ€™m a first year student at ESSEC and I live in Paris (actually in Cergy but Paris sounds nicer). I donâ€™t know how to describe myself so i asked some friends to do so for me and they all said that i was very spontaneous, Iâ€™m always seeking new adventures, that I was the sunshine of their life and that Iâ€™ll act like a mom or a kindergarten teacher for most of the time (i didnâ€™t threat them to said this i swear)

				<h2><strong>Cooking</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I adore cooking for me and for others and iâ€™m actually willing to purchase my studies after ESSEC in this field. I found it very restful to take the time to cook and itâ€™s my way to relax after a stressful day. I think that one of the most fascinating thing in the world is the Gastronomy of a country. It tells you so many things about the land and the people and it is always very complexe even when it seems simple. I like to believe that cooking is a science so itâ€™s very precise but at the same time itâ€™s something that goes with the flow and you just have to figure out how to balance this two aspects if you want to be the greatest chef alive.

				<h2><strong>Music</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Im also a huge fan of all king of music. My dad was the first one to introduce me to this world, then my mom added her musical influence into my playlists. I love the fact that millions and billions of people can be gathered around one common sound that we call music. You can never feel alone when you love listening to music since you will always found an artist whoâ€™s been trough the same thins as you. Music rhythms our lives, and the worlds is much nicer with a good soundtrack

				<h2><strong>Travelling</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Something that gathers my two other passions is travelling. In fact, I truly believe that in order to get to know well another culture, you have to at least test itâ€™s gastronomy and itâ€™s music and study it if you really want to dig on it. Itâ€™s always amazing to think that in other lands, people with the same attributes as ours lives a complete different way of living and that traditions thats seems very normal for us seems strange to them. The human life is so diversified that is would take more than a life time to get to know every culture and traditions, but I like to believe that i will achieve that one day.
